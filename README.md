# SOLID principles on JavaScript

Knowing a programming language doesn’t make you a software developer. Absolutely every software developer who works with any object oriented language need to be familiar with SOLID principles. For those who are new to programming and doesn’t yet know what those principles are, SOLID is an acronym, which stands for the following:

* Single responsibility principle
* Open-closed principle
* Liskov substitution principle
* Interface segregation principle
* Dependency inversion principle

This repository contains five sample applications, each demonstrating one of the principles in action. All the solutions contain exactly the same application that is gradually being refactored to adhere to each of the SOLID principles.

For each principle, there is a link to an article that provides more in-depth explanation of what that principle is and why you would need to use it.
